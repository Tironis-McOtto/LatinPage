  <h3>THIS PAGE IS A STUDENT PROJECT. INFORMATION IS NOT ACCURATE. AS I BUILD THE INFORMATION WILL BE CORRECTED.</h3>
  
  <p>While learning Latin, you may the itch to start reading original Latin text. At the intermediate level most if not all the
    orignal Latin works are difficult to read. But there are some original text that you can still tackle.
    You should still read easier text written for learners. These are graded readers are a great tool to build vocabulary,
    grammar, and reading profieciency. Here are some that you can find on the web and are free downlaodable PDFs:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Pons Tironem - R.B. Appleton</li>
    <li>Easy Latin Stories for Beginners - George L. Bennet</li>
    <li>Colloquia Latina - Benjamin L. D'Ooge</li>
    <li>Ritchies's Fabulae Faciles: A First Latin Reader - Francis Ritchie</li>
  </ul>
     
  <p>Just to scratch the itch below are some recommendations of some of the less difficult works you can try that use clear grammar and straightforward vocabulary:</p>  

  <ul>
    <li>Caesar - De Bello Gallico</li>
    <li>Cornelius Nepos - Lives of the Eminent Commanders</li>
    <li>Vulgate Bible</li>
    <li>Eutropius - Brevarium Historiae Romanae</li>
  </ul>

  <p>You will have difficulty, but it is a good way to measure your progress and it keeps you motivated. Don't get
    discouraged. As you continue reading your graded readers, learn vocabulary, and grammar, these works will get easier
    to read. Remember learning a language, especially and ancient language, is a life-long endeavor, but you will be
    rewarded each time you return to the original works and find yourself understanding a little more. GOOD LUCK!</p>
